## Week 3

### Weekly Recap

- This week we learned how to create themes using WordPress. 
- We used CSS to create the style of the theme. The style.css page acts as a visual design and metadata. It contains the site appearance giving me the ability to make it colorful, change the layout, and edit the font style.
- The index page was used to create the layout of the page using markups. It displays the content with or without the styling, using a simple HTML structure page along with PHP code to display content. 
- The function php was used to be the brain of the code. It gives the opportunity to add or override functionality in WordPress without touching the other files. We used the Enqueuing Assets. Which is a function that is used to load CSS and JavaScript files to the theme.
